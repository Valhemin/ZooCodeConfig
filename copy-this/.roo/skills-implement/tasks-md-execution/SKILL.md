TRIGGER: implementing tasks from a tasks.md file phase-by-phase with checklist gates
OUTPUT: compact — task marked complete only after real verification, blocked task with exact error verbatim, next action
SKIP: free-form implementation without a tasks.md driving the work

---


When implementing from `tasks.md`:

1. Check checklist status first.
2. Load only relevant docs for the current scope.
3. Execute one task or coherent scope.
4. Self-review immediately.
5. Run focused verification.
6. Fix before moving on.
7. Mark task complete only after it is actually done.
8. Continue until all requested tasks are done, blocked, or user stops you.

Never claim passed verification without running it. If tests don't exist, report the gap and use available build/typecheck/lint/manual checks.

## Post-Task API Testing

After completing any task that adds or modifies a backend endpoint or API handler: run `api-testing` skill. This is default — no explicit user request needed. Skip only for pure frontend tasks or when the user explicitly says "skip tests".
