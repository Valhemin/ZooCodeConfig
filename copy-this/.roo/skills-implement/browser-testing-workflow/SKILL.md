description: End-to-end browser testing workflow combining Playwright (interaction) and Chrome DevTools (performance). Enable MCPs before use.

TRIGGER: user explicitly requests E2E testing, browser testing, UI verification, visual QA, or Playwright/DevTools testing
OUTPUT: report — pass/fail per phase (smoke, interaction, performance) with screenshots and performance metrics
SKIP: automatically after any implementation without an explicit user request

## When to Use / When NOT to Use

**Only when user explicitly requests E2E or UI testing.** Never trigger automatically after implementation.

**Use when:** User asks for browser testing, E2E testing, UI verification, visual QA, performance testing, or Playwright/DevTools testing.
**Do NOT use:** After any implementation without an explicit user request. API changes, backend logic, refactors, or pure frontend component work do not trigger this skill automatically.

Use after implementing UI features to verify both visual correctness and performance before shipping.

## MCP Requirements

Enable one or both depending on need:
- **Playwright** — interaction, screenshots, responsive testing.
- **Chrome DevTools** — performance, network, memory, rendering.

## Workflow

### 1. Smoke (Playwright)
- Navigate to the changed page/component.
- Screenshot desktop (1280px) + mobile (375px).
- Check for console errors.
- Verify no broken layout or missing content.

### 2. Interaction (Playwright)
- Walk through the primary user flow.
- Test form inputs, button clicks, navigation.
- Verify state transitions (loading → success, empty → filled).
- Screenshot each meaningful state.

### 3. Performance (Chrome DevTools)
- Check network waterfall for slow/failed requests.
- Measure DOM node count.
- Look for layout shifts and long tasks.
- Check memory for leaks (navigate away and back, compare heap).

### 4. Cross-check
- Compare screenshots against DESIGN.md tokens if available.
- Verify responsive behavior matches spec.
- Flag any performance regression vs baseline.

## Decision Matrix

| Situation | MCPs to enable |
|---|---|
| Visual change only (colors, layout, text) | Playwright only |
| Performance concern (slow load, jank) | Chrome DevTools only |
| New feature (UI + functionality) | Both |
| Regression after refactor | Both |

## Output

- Pass/fail per phase.
- Screenshots with annotations.
- Performance metrics (network timing, DOM count, CLS).
- Issues ranked by severity.
- Recommended fixes.
