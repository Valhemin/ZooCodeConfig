# Mode-Native Artifact Workflow

This setup does not rely on mode-native workflows. Use modes, rules, skills, and templates directly.

When a request needs structured delivery: use the `superpowers:writing-plans` skill to plan, `superpowers:executing-plans` to implement, and `superpowers:requesting-code-review` to review.

If a project already has `.specify/` scripts/templates, prefer them. If not, use `docs/specs/<feature-or-project>/` and this bundle's templates.

Do not use command names as the workflow source of truth. The workflow belongs to the selected mode and relevant skills.
