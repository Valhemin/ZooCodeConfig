TRIGGER: authoring a complete implementation-ready spec pack for a new project or major feature
OUTPUT: detailed — all 13 spec pack files written to docs/specs/<feature>/, pack complete only when consistency analysis is READY
SKIP: small features that don't need a full spec pack; use product-requirements and implementation-plan directly

---


Use for new projects and major features.
